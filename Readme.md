## Overview
This code is a Go program that fetches Golang code files from a GitHub repository, parses them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), serializes the AST into a file, and prints the AST for demonstration purposes.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The code imports the necessary packages, including the "github.com/google/go-github/github" package for interacting with the GitHub API and the "golang.org/x/oauth2" package for authentication. 
2. The "fetchAndParseFile" function is defined. This function takes a GitHub client, owner, repository, and file path as parameters. It fetches the content of the file from the GitHub repository using the client. Then, it parses the fetched Golang code into an AST using the "go/parser" package. Next, it serializes the AST into a file using the "encoding/gob" package. Finally, it prints a message indicating that the AST has been serialized. 
3. The "processRepo" function is defined. This function takes a GitHub client, owner, repository, and directory path as parameters. It fetches the content of the directory from the GitHub repository using the client. Then, it iterates over the directory content. If a content item is a file with a ".go" extension, it calls the "fetchAndParseFile" function to fetch and parse the file. If a content item is a directory, it recursively calls the "processRepo" function to process the subdirectory. 
4. The "main" function is defined. It initializes the GitHub client using an access token. It registers the "ast.File" type with the "gob" package so that it can be serialized. Finally, it calls the "processRepo" function to start processing the specified GitHub repository.

### Notes
In order to run this code, you need to replace "YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN" with an actual GitHub access token and provide the correct values for the GitHub owner and repository in the "main" function.
